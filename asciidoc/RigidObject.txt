or get the linear velocity as a cloned instance.

=== Parameter: linearVelocity
_Is optional_ +
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
The new linear velocity

=== Returns:
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
The linear velocity of this object

== Method: applyImpulseAtPoint
Applies an impulse at a given point relative the the object's transformation. +
The vector is measured relative to world space. +
(Applies a linear and an angular impulse)

=== Parameter: impulse
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
The impulse to be applied

=== Parameter: point
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
The point where the impulse will be applied



== Method: applyAngularImpulse
Applies an angular impulse at the center of mass.

=== Parameter: angularImpulse
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
The angular impulse to be applied



== Method: applyLinearImpulse
Applies a linear impulse at the center of mass. +
The vector is measured relative to world space.

=== Parameter: linearImpulse
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
The linear impulse to be applied



== Method: findBoneByPath
Gets a child node of the object's skeleton by it's name. +
Returns undefined if the node is not found. +
The whole path needs to be specified (i.e. ['Back','Hip','Thigh_Right','Shin_Right']).

=== Returns:
_Type:_ BoneObject +
The node



== Method: textureAnimationTime
Can set the animation time (like a playhead) in seconds, +
or get the animation time.

=== Parameter: animationTime
_Is optional_ +
_Type:_ Number +
Time in seconds elapsed since the start point of the animation

=== Returns:
_Type:_ Number +
The time in seconds elapsed since the start point of the animation
