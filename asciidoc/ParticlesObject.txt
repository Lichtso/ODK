= Class: ParticlesObject
Can't be constructed. Objects are created by loading containers.

=== Parent Class
link:PhysicObject.html[PhysicObject]

=== Property: maxParticles
_Type:_ Integer +
(Readonly) The maximum number of particles

=== Property: texture
_Type:_ String +
The filename of the used texture

=== Property: transformAligned
_Type:_ Boolean +
Wether the particles are aligned towards the camera or towards their own transformation

=== Property: systemLife
_Type:_ Number +
The lifetime of the particle system in seconds (or -1.0 for eternal life)

=== Property: lifeMin
_Type:_ Number +
The minimum lifetime of a particle in seconds

=== Property: lifeMax
_Type:_ Number +
The maximum lifetime of a particle in seconds

=== Property: sizeMin
_Type:_ Number +
The minimum size of a particle

=== Property: sizeMax
_Type:_ Number +
The maximum size of a particle



== Method: force
Can set the global force (e.g. gravity) via a Vector3, +
or get the gloal force as a cloned instance.

=== Parameter: force
_Is optional_ +
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
The gloabl force to be applied

=== Returns:
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
A clone of the system's global force



== Method: posMin
Can set the minimum position via a Vector3, +
or get the minimum position as a cloned instance. +
The min. and max. position define a box in which the particles are spawned.

=== Parameter: position
_Is optional_ +
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
The minimum position

=== Returns:
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
A clone of the system's minimum position



== Method: posMax
Can set the maximum position via a Vector3, +
or get the maximum position as a cloned instance. +
The min. and max. position define a box in which the particles are spawned.

=== Parameter: position
_Is optional_ +
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
The maximum position

=== Returns:
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
A clone of the system's maximum position



== Method: dirMin
Can set the minimum direction via a Vector3, +
or get the minimum direction as a cloned instance. +
The min. and max. direction define a vector space, the particles will be spawned +
with a constant velocity that is a member of this vector space.

=== Parameter: direction
_Is optional_ +
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
The minimum direction

=== Returns:
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
A clone of the system's minimum direction



== Method: dirMax
Can set the maximum direction via a Vector3, +
or get the maximum direction as a cloned instance. +
The min. and max. direction define a vector space, the particles will be spawned +
with a constant velocity that is a member of this vector space.

=== Parameter: direction
_Is optional_ +
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
The maximum direction

=== Returns:
_Type:_ link:Vector3.html[Vector3] +
A clone of the system's maximum direction
