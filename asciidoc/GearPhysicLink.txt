= Class: GearPhysicLink
Represents two gears. Doesn't fix the objects in place, you are free to place them wherever you want.

=== Parent Class

=== Constructor: objectA, objectB, axisA, axisB, ratio
_Types:_ RigidObject, RigidObject, link:Vector3.html[Vector3], link:Vector3.html[Vector3], Number +
The both objects to link together, two Vector3 as description of the axis of the joint relative to each object +
and the ratio of the gears radii (objectA to objectB). 1.0 means that they rotate equally.

=== Property: ratio
_Type:_ Number +
The ratio of the gears radii (objectA to objectB). 1 means that they rotate equally.



== Method: axisA
Can set the axisA via a Vector3, +
or get the axisA as a cloned instance.

=== Parameter: axisA
_Is optional_ +
_Type:_ link:Matrix4.html[Matrix4] +
The new axisA vector

=== Returns:
_Type:_ link:Matrix4.html[Matrix4] +
A copy of the axisA vector



== Method: axisB
Can set the axisB via a Vector3, +
or get the axisB as a cloned instance.

=== Parameter: axisB
_Is optional_ +
_Type:_ link:Matrix4.html[Matrix4] +
The new axisB vector

=== Returns:
_Type:_ link:Matrix4.html[Matrix4] +
A copy of the axisB vector
